## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project I got to practice a lot of styling and learned how to use Flexbox more seamlessly. I also learned more about form validation using Bootstrap. This was one of the biggest challenges for me during the project but also one of the most valuable. 

### Continued development

 Form validation, I'm coming for you :)
